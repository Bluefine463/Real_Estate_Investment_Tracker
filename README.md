üè° Real Estate Investment Tracker
Welcome!
This is a simple prototype that we designed to track your real estate investments ‚Äî lands, apartments, villas, plots, and more.

You can add properties, edit details, track expenses, view your portfolio, and monitor returns, all from a clean dashboard.
Well! you enter your property details manually for now ,however we calculate everything thereafter even the future prediction of the property value 
using a simple linear regression batch processing system( model's output is utilized rather than querying the model ,if you know what i mean)

‚ú® Features
Add, edit, and delete properties (Land, Apartment, Villa, Plot, Warehouse)
Add and manage expenses for each property
Dashboard view for a quick overview of your investments
Portfolio page showing detailed charts for "Land" investments
Clean and responsive UI using Bootstrap blah blah blah

NO FRAMEWORKS are used so simple but!
Code gets longer and slower so..
will introduce some frameworks with cool architecture :-> the system wont know, it's being used :-)
SO BE PATIENT BRO!!
in the meantime , Please contribute in anyway if you can.
